PrerequisiteA Github account.
The account has been authorised to access the private repository where the package is located.
R and Rstudio. ðŸ˜‚

      <description>The caseThe software and versionVisulisation tool - ApsimNG build in toolsPotential automated validation - R/PythonThe caseApsimNG is a great tool for climate change studies once we have a comprehensive plant model with realibale climate data and detailted soil propterties. However, it will be waste of time if the simulation results make no biological sense. The validation of a model is a key step before we ran the massive simulations for climate change scenarios.</description>

      <description>IntroductionWater BalanceNitrogen BalanceBiomass BalanceIntroductionIt is critical to inspect the simulation result from a Apsim model so that we are confidence to say the model does what is expected. For a beginner, it might feel hopeless when we stare at the UI with hundreds of parameters can be modified and output. Despite the complicity of Apsim, the entire idea of simulation checking is about biologically meaningful.</description>

      <description>Reason about this postChange the default library via environment variablesReason about this postMany R learner (including myself) probably came across the default R library issues in windows system, especially when you are using a company laptop/PC. There are lots of discussion about changing the default directories in R on StackOverFlow and other websites. However, I found using Environment variables seems to be the easiest way to go.</description>

      <description>DriverThe ideaIngredientsSoftware and LibrariesGithub repositoriesStep by Step receiptNext stepDriverOriginally, I was keen to just use the githubPage approach to do this documentation blog because it feels easy. Then, the Yihuiâ€™s book Blogdown introduces this amazing HUGO themes. I became greed and want to have the best of both worlds although I realised that githubPage is not the number one recommendation for deploying the website when half way through the book.</description>

      <description>IngredientsHow to clone the ApsimX repositoryHow to buildIngredientsVisual Studio is essential.
Git has been built into visual studio IDE from 2013 update 1. So not necessary to install git independently. But it is necessary to have some basic understanding of git.
Github account to clone the repository to local machines. Github is a great platform that host all the repository for many projects.</description>

      <title>A Plain Markdown Post (The reference)</title>
      <link>/2016/12/30/a-plain-markdown-post-the-reference/</link>

      <description>This is a post written in plain Markdown (*.md) instead of R Markdown (*.Rmd). The major differences are:
 You cannot run any R code in a plain Markdown document, whereas in an R Markdown document, you can embed R code chunks (```{r}); A plain Markdown post is rendered through Blackfriday, and an R Markdown document is compiled by rmarkdown and Pandoc.  There are many differences in syntax between Blackfriday&amp;rsquo;s Markdown and Pandoc&amp;rsquo;s Markdown.</description>

      <description>This is a documentation website for recording errors and tricks while learning the APSIM Next Generation to do model development. Some random thoughts might also come along every now and then.
The theme was forked from jrutheiser/hugo-lithium-theme and modified by Yihui Xie.</description>
