# Ingredients
 
 - [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) is essential.  
 - [Git](https://git-scm.com/) has been built into visual studio IDE from 2013 update 1. So not necessary to install git independently. But it is necessary to have some basic understanding of git.  
 - [Github account](https://github.com/) to clone the repository to local machines. Github is a great platform that host all the repository for many projects. _[Happy Git and Github for the useR](https://happygitwithr.com/)_ is a great starting point to learn how to use git and github, although it is a bit R-centered. :satisfied:
