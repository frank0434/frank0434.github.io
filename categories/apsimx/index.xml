      <description>AimModify the plant model itselfAimWater stress has a significant effect on leaf area expansion rate. To implenmentthe effects, one needs to modify the model or use manager script to update the model states.
Modify the plant model itselfThe process of the effect. Water stress hit the leaf and reduce the rate of expansion. This could be quantified by calculating the ratio of water demand and supply.</description>

      <description>The caseThe software and versionVisulisation tool - ApsimNG build in toolsPotential automated validation - R/PythonThe caseApsimNG is a great tool for climate change studies once we have a comprehensive plant model with realibale climate data and detailted soil propterties. However, it will be waste of time if the simulation results make no biological sense. The validation of a model is a key step before we ran the massive simulations for climate change scenarios.</description>

      <description>IntroductionWater BalanceNitrogen BalanceBiomass BalanceIntroductionIt is critical to inspect the simulation result from a Apsim model so that we are confidence to say the model does what is expected. For a beginner, it might feel hopeless when we stare at the UI with hundreds of parameters can be modified and output. Despite the complicity of Apsim, the entire idea of simulation checking is about biologically meaningful.</description>

      <description>IngredientsHow to clone the ApsimX repositoryHow to buildIngredientsVisual Studio is essential.
Git has been built into visual studio IDE from 2013 update 1. So not necessary to install git independently. But it is necessary to have some basic understanding of git.
Github account to clone the repository to local machines. Github is a great platform that host all the repository for many projects.</description>
