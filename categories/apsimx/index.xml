      <description>1 A simple workflow2 Load prepared data for 3 soil parameters3 Set directory structure in an R environment4 Construct the configuration5 Invoke ApsimxReferenceIn the previous post about using ApsimX built-in feature to do multiplication of simulation files, the Edit flag was briefly discussed with basic instruction. This post explores different approaches to integrate the feature into a workflow.

      <description>1. Invalid report variables2. Radiation UnitsTo be continueThis page is the FAQ which contains random errors and potential solutions of ApsimX
1. Invalid report variablesError in report Output: Invalid report variables found:RUEshootPossible Cause: 0 or other numeric values divided by 0.
Solution: Add a small number into the denominator. [ExtraVariables].Script.AverageInterceptedRadiation + 0.00000001
2. Radiation UnitsContributed by Edmar
Note: Units in the paper were in MJ of PAR â€¦APSIM works in global radiation so we can multiply it by 2x</description>

      <description>The caseThe software and versionVisulisation tool - ApsimNG build in toolsPotential automated validation - R/PythonThe caseApsimNG is a great tool for climate change studies once we have a comprehensive plant model with realibale climate data and detailted soil propterties. However, it will be waste of time if the simulation results make no biological sense. The validation of a model is a key step before we ran the massive simulations for climate change scenarios.</description>

      <description>IntroductionWater BalanceNitrogen BalanceBiomass BalanceIntroductionIt is critical to inspect the simulation result from a Apsim model so that we are confidence to say the model does what is expected. For a beginner, it might feel hopeless when we stare at the UI with hundreds of parameters can be modified and output. Despite the complicity of Apsim, the entire idea of simulation checking is about biologically meaningful.</description>

      <description>IngredientsHow to clone the ApsimX repositoryHow to buildIngredientsVisual Studio is essential.
Git has been built into visual studio IDE from 2013 update 1. So not necessary to install git independently. But it is necessary to have some basic understanding of git.
Github account to clone the repository to local machines. Github is a great platform that host all the repository for many projects.</description>
